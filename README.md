# World Leveling

A Minecraft mod that adds powerful abilities as you level up certain skills (i.e. mining, combat, farming). These
abilities range from simple player effects like increasing your movement speed to unlocking complex new multiblock
structures.

* **Minecraft Version**: 1.18.2
* **Modloader**: [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)

## Project Status

Very work-in-progress. Not even close to playable. Want to at least complete the mining, farming, and combat ability
trees before a stable version is officially released.
